Meeting agenda for LOLCODE v1.1
  Re: LOLCODE Developer Standardization Meeting

1. Rules of the meeting
  a. To facilitate the meeting, there will be one or two operators in the
     channel.  This person will be responsible for voicing the appropriate
     users, maintaining the peace in the channel, and keeping the meeting on
     schedule.
  b. The channel will be moderated.  Only users with voices or op may speak.
  c. Only users who are developing an interpreter or compiler for LOLCODE may
     be given voice privileges.  These people are the ones to whom suggestions
     by bystanders (non-voiced users) should be directed, and they should
     weigh the suggestion for its merits (not for its opinion) and paste it
     verbatim in-channel if deemed relevant.
  d. Bystanders are encouraged to use notices instead of messages.
  e. Voting will be facilitated with the use of a bot.  Voting can be either
     silent or public.  The following means of voting are supported:
       [in-channel] "!yes" "!no" or "<botname>, yes" "<botname>, no"
       /msg <botname> YES <channel>
       /notice <botname YES <channel> (the bot will not confirm your vote)
2. Standard references
  a. See http://lolcode.com for the current LOLCODE canon and contributions.
3. Quick IRC reference
  a. /join #LOLCODE
    - Join the channel specified (channels start with #)
  b. /msg <user> <message goes here>
    - Send a private message to the specified user
    - Note, on freenode you must be registered!
  c. /notice <user> <message goes here>
    - Send a notice to the specified user
    - Same as /msg, you must be registered
  d. /part <channel>
    - Leave a channel.
    - An optional reason can be specified after the channel.
  e. /quit <reason>
    - Leave the IRC network for <reason>.
4. Order of business
  a. Call to order
  b. Roll call
    i.   All developers should state their project.
    ii.  The moderator will give voices to appropriate users.
  c. Minutes <none>
  d. Officers' reports
    -- If any of the creator(s) are present, they might want to say some
       words.  Otherwise, no big deal.  Make sure you're read up on the
       current LOLCODE canon and most of the contributions.
  e. Commitee reports <none>
  f. Old business
    i.   CAN HAS statement
        - Is this a preprocessing directive or an actual statement?
        - If it's a preprocessing directive, is its argument quoted or unquoted or both?
    ii.  I HAS A <var>
        - Assignment at declaration time syntax? Using ITZ, R, or something else?
        - Rename ARRAY to BUKKIT?
    iii. GTFO and potential continue statement
        - Allow named breaks/continues?
    
  g. New business
    i.   Block comments?
    ii.  File IO
        - How do we open/close files?
    iii. Continue statement
    iv.  Reintroduce more block terminators instead of just KTHX?
        - LOL{OL} for terminating multiple blocks?
          - Significant parsing issues.
    v.   Allow noninteger keys for BUKKIT/ARRAY? Eg, make it a dictionary/hash instead?
    vi.  Is LOLCode case sensitive or case insensitive?
    vii. Replacement of expressions with RPN/PRON notation?
        - Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a means of expressing arithmetic expressions
          in a stack-based manner. A quick overview can be found here:
          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation . Since LOLCode lacks a
          defined operator precedence and any sort of grouping operator such as parantheses,
          RPN seems well suited to the language.
        - If no RPN, what is LOLCode's order of evaluation? As per C, or something else?
        - If no RPN, do we need a grouping operator?
    iix. Variable Typing
        - Introduce strongly typed variables?
          - Required or optional?
        - Which typecasts are implicit, and which are explicit?
          - Casting from NUMBAR to YARN
          - Casting from YARN to NUMBAR
          - Treating an array like a primitive
          - Treating a primitive like an array
        - Is there an explicit 'empty array' syntax?
    ix.  Are arrays assigned by reference or by value? Eg, if you assign an array to another
         variable, and modify the original variable, does the new variable show the
         modification?
    x.   Should a floating point type be introduced?
    xi.  Should function calls be introduced?
        - Are functions first-class? If so, can you declare them like normal functions?
        - Declaration syntax
        - Calling syntax
    xii. Should a GOTO statement be introduced?
        - GOTO syntax
        - Label syntax
    xiii.Should a GOSUB statement be introduced?
        - GOSUB syntax
        - RET syntax
    xiv. Should a statement continuation keyword be introduced?
    xv.  String operators (substring, concatenation, search, etc)
        - Part of the base language, or a standard library (if we have functions)?
        - Syntax?
    xvi. Keyword for 'null'?
    xvii.Is there a way to unset a value in an array? By setting it to null?
    xiix.'else if' syntax?
    xix. Switch statement?
